(Clear explanation of hash table operations, hashing function, collision handling, and time complexities.)


1. Hash Table Implementation:
   Correct hash table structure implementation:(Hash table is implemented correctly, and data is stored and retrieved efficiently.)

   Hashing function implementation:(Uses a suitable hashing function to distribute keys effectively.)

   Collision handling:(Implements proper collision handling using chaining or open addressing.)

2. User Interface
   Menu options for hash table management:(Includes options for adding, searching, removing, and displaying items.)

3. Integration with previous functionalities:(UI seamlessly integrates hash table management with functionalities from previous projects.)
                                             (Hash table interacts meaningfully with other components, such as linked list or dynamic array.)

   Time complexity reporting:(Accurate explanation of time complexities for hash table operations in README.mdLinks to an external site.


   Handling of edge cases:(Handles cases like collisions, searching/removing non-existent items, and edge scenarios robustly.)
